# Dijkstra Implementation
 Dijkstra's algorithm implementation for computing shortest travel times between sectors in a directed graph.


- Input Format

n m                 # number of nodes and edges

u v t               # directed edge from u to v with time t (repeat m times)

s                   # source node

- Output Format

Sector 0: Travel time = x

Sector 1: Travel time = x
...


- Details

Algorithm: Dijkstra's shortest path

Time Complexity: O((m + n) log n)

Requirements: Python 3.x, standard library only
